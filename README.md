# Shot Data Calculator
This project was developed using Python and focuses on analyzing basketball player shot data to gain insights into their shooting performance.

# Overview
The Basketball Shot Analysis Project provides a detailed analysis of basketball player shot data. By processing the provided CSV file containing shot location (x, y coordinates) and shot outcome (made or missed), this project aims to extract valuable statistics and visualizations to understand shooting performance.

# Features
Data Analysis: The project uses Python's itertools library to analyze a CSV file with extensive individual basketball player shot data.

Calculation and Comparison: Various calculations, including shot percentage and field goal percentage, are performed on the data. Additionally, comparisons to NBA averages are made for a comprehensive analysis.

Data Visualization: The project uses the matplotlib library to generate visualizations that illustrate the analysis results.

# Data Source
