# Shot-Data-Calculator

Created using Python. I wanted to create a sports analysis project. I had access to CSV file containing basketball player's shot location (x, y coordinates) and whether they made the shot or not. 

• Designed a program in Python that uses itertools to analyze a CSV file containing thousands of records of individual basketball player shot data
• Performed a variety of calculations (such as shot percentage, field goal percentage, and comparisons to NBA averages) on the data and used matplotlib to generate visualizations of the results
